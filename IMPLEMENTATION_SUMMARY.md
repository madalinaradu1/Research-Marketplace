# URAF Website Implementation Summary

## Project Structure

We've created a comprehensive foundation for the Undergraduate Research and Fellowships (URAF) website using AWS Amplify Studio. Here's what we've implemented:

### Data Models

We've defined a complete GraphQL schema (`schema.graphql`) with the following models:

- **User**: Student, faculty, and admin profiles
- **ResearchOpportunity**: Research projects seeking students
- **Application**: Student applications to opportunities
- **Project**: Active research projects
- **Document**: Uploaded files (resumes, project documents)
- **ProjectFile**: Files associated with specific projects
- **Event**: Deadlines, workshops, etc.
- **Notification**: System messages and alerts

### UI Components

We've created several Amplify Studio UI components:

- **ResearchOpportunityCard**: Displays research opportunity details
- **ProfileCard**: Shows and allows editing of user profiles
- **ApplicationForm**: Form for applying to research opportunities

### React Components

We've implemented core React components:

- **Header**: Navigation bar with responsive design
- **Footer**: Site footer with contact information and links

### Pages

We've created key pages for the application:

- **Dashboard**: Personalized homepage with recommendations and activity
- **SearchPage**: Search interface for finding research opportunities
- **ProfilePage**: User profile management and document uploads
- **ActivityPage**: Tracking applications and projects

### AWS Services Integration

We've set up integration with AWS services:

- **Cognito**: Authentication setup for user management
- **AppSync**: GraphQL API configuration
- **DynamoDB**: Data storage for all models
- **S3**: File storage for documents
- **Lambda**: Custom functions for search and recommendations

### Documentation

We've provided comprehensive documentation:

- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Detailed deployment guide
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Comprehensive project description
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This implementation summary

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Initialize Amplify Project**:
   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```

2. **Push Resources to AWS**:
   ```bash
   amplify push
   ```

3. **Configure Amplify Studio**:
   - Import UI components
   - Customize theme
   - Configure authentication flow

4. **Implement Additional Pages**:
   - Opportunity details page
   - Application details page
   - Project details page
   - Admin dashboard

5. **Set Up CampusPress Integration**:
   - Create public-facing pages
   - Implement SSO with Cognito
   - Add links to the Amplify application

6. **Testing**:
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test opportunity search and application
   - Test file uploads and downloads
   - Test responsive design

7. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy to production
   - Configure custom domain
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

## Conclusion

The URAF website implementation provides a solid foundation for connecting students with research opportunities at Grand Canyon University. The AWS Amplify Studio approach allows for rapid development and easy customization, while the serverless architecture ensures scalability and reliability.

With the components and structure in place, the application can be further developed and refined to meet the specific needs of the university's research program.
